<h1>The Best Movies According to Aleks</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time.</h2>

<h3>Lego Batman Movie</h3>
<p>
A very comedic movie that directly represents me.<br/>
Batman's character is setup to build character growth and develop <br/>
into someone who's not as self-centered as he was at the beginning of the movie. <br/>
Him being afraid of letting people get close to him and then being forced to <br/>
accept them as his own family was a huge indicator of substantial growth.

<h3>Whiplash</h3>
<p>
Whiplash is an absolute masterpiece of a movie and I could<br/>
use this entire page just talking about it but it's amazing! The acting alone <br/>
was beyond subpar and the characters interactions with each other made it that much better!
</p>

<h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
<p>
Quite honestly this is another movie that directly represents me<br/>
and it was such a heartwarming and carefully constructed anime love story.
